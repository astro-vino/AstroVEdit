### **üí° Advanced Techniques for Users to Try**

#### **üéØ Layer Stack Optimization Techniques:**
- **Performance Boost**: Flatten multiple adjustment layers after fine-tuning to improve rendering speed
- **Selective Processing**: Use layer masks to apply different adjustments to stars vs nebulosity
- **Non-Destructive Workflow**: Keep original layers hidden but preserved for future adjustments
- **Layer Organization**: Group related adjustments and flatten them into logical processing stages

#### **üîß Professional Masking Workflows:**
- **Luminosity Separation**: Create masks from current viewport to separate bright and dark regions
- **Star Protection**: Use inverted masks to protect stars during nebula enhancement
- **Gradient Masks**: Apply blur to masks for smooth transitions between processed areas
- **Mask Refinement**: Use levels controls to fine-tune mask contrast and coverage

#### **‚ö° Performance Optimization Tips:**
- **Fast Preview Mode**: Watch for orange indicator during adjustments for optimal responsiveness
- **Layer Flattening**: Collapse complex adjustment stacks to reduce computational overhead
- **Selective Rendering**: Toggle layer visibility to isolate processing effects and improve performance
- **Cache Management**: Understand how layer changes invalidate cache for efficient workflow planning
