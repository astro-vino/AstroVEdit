- **Memory:** 4 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB recommended for large FITS files
- **Storage:** 500 MB available space
- **Graphics:** DirectX 11 compatible graphics card (recommended for hardware acceleration)
- **Optional:** GraXpert installation for plugin functionality

### Installation
#### Windows Installer 
1. Download the latest `AstroVEdit-1.0.0-Setup.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/astro-vino/AstroVEdit/releases)
2. Run the installer as Administrator
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Launch AstroVEdit from Start Menu or Desktop shortcut

#### GraXpert Plugin Setup (Optional)
1. Download and install [GraXpert](https://github.com/Steffenhir/GraXpert) from the official repository
2. AstroVEdit will auto-detect GraXpert in common installation paths:
   - `%LocalAppData%\Programs\GraXpert`
   - `C:\Program Files\GraXpert`
   - `C:\Program Files (x86)\GraXpert`
3. If not found automatically, you'll be prompted to locate the GraXpert executable

### Quick Start Guide

#### Basic Workflow
1. **Open an Image**: File ‚Üí Open or drag-and-drop a FITS file
2. **Add Adjustments**: Use the Adjustments panel to add enhancement layers
3. **Apply Presets**: Try astrophotography presets for quick professional results
4. **Fine-tune Settings**: Click the gear icon next to any adjustment to modify parameters
5. **Layer Management**: Use show/hide toggles to compare before/after results
6. **Monitor Changes**: Watch the real-time histogram and preview updates
7. **Save Your Work**: File ‚Üí Save to preserve your edited image

#### Astrophotography Workflow
1. **Load Your Image**: Open FITS, TIFF, or other astronomical image formats
2. **Apply Narrowband Preset**: Choose SHO, HOO, or other palettes for instant color grading
3. **Fine-tune with Layers**: Add Levels, Curves, or Color Balance adjustments
4. **Use GraXpert Plugin**: Apply background extraction or denoising as separate layers
5. **Compare Results**: Toggle layer visibility to compare original vs processed versions
6. **Export Final Image**: Save in your preferred format with all adjustments applied
